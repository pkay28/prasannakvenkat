            <h3>HI, I’M PRASANNA</h3><br>
            <p style="font-size: medium;"> Hi, I’m Prasanna -- nice to meet you! I'm an enthusiastic learner and a passionate computer science engineer with a vision to build products for everyone in the world. I love to design cool stuff - products, contents, and curating experiences for people. I’ve contributed for a bunch of projects, Non-government organization, and a few independent music albums. Apart from design, I work as a DevOps Engineer. (Yes, I know the release is coming. :P) I’ve also spearheaded a team in building a product from India.(WIP) I enjoy beaches, hills, fine ice creams, doodling, writing, which I’d love to talk about more, but that’s probably not what you are here for. Saving it for some other time. Instead, I will be writing about my experience. There’s always learning in everything we do, and I strongly believe in that. 
                <br> <br> P.S: Feel free to ask me about the beaches or ice cream later, though.
            </p1>
