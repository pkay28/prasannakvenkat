            <br><h3 style="text-align: center;"> About our venture, how we went beyond screens and algorithms!</h3>
            <br> <p>
                Most of us have a vision of building a good product. At Goodplace, we aspire to make a great product where users can discover individuals and communities where they can belong and we enable everyone in the world to start something wonderful - ah that’s a lot of people! 
                <br><br> When we started developing Goodplace screens, a mvp version of the app, we quickly learned that we needed to ensure we are building the product for everyone. 
                <br><br><h3 style="text-align: center;"> Understanding Constraints</h3>
                <br><p>A lot of existing apps in the market have been doing the same thing. The population who are new to the internet or existing users who come to such platforms often face many of these constraints - such as appearance tests, finding it hard to express themselves to other people, getting ghosted by some person, or meeting a fake person. (Keeping the competitor study short) We came up with different categories, and tried to solve all the pain points in a user journey.</p>
                </p>
                <br><br><h3 style="text-align: center;"> Thoughts</h3>
                <p>How do we make this solution a world-class one from India is a question we keep asking ourselves whenever we try to solve a problem. Be it designing our search, or discovery page, the result page, and so many other interesting screens.</p>
                <br><br><h3 style="text-align: center;"> Beyond design systems and algorithms </h3>
                <p>How do we make our product available for everyone in the world. We tried to understand the behaviour of people while defining certain features, sometimes we don’t have to explain some features to the users because that’s something they would have been doing since childhood, how do we place the UI elements so the users in poor network connectivity areas would also be able to access sufficient features, etc. </p>
                <br><br><h3 style="text-align: center;"> Learnings </h3>
                <p>As a designer and a member of the founding team I understood that our job is more than just building screens and writing clean codes. To build empathy for the users and solve their problems while mainintaining high bar for design is something I will keep in my mind while working on anything. </p>
